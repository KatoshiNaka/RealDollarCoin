        <p
          >Real Dollar is a community driven token that is currently hosted on
          BNB Smart Chain, that aims to become the medium of exchange between
          all crypto currencies in the near future. As the Crypto industry
          strides towards becoming the global financial system, the sheer number
          of different cryptocurrencies poses an issue that needs to be
          resolved. There needs to be a medium of exchange between
          cryptocurrencies that could help everyone in the community determine
          the value of every coin.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently the US Dollar forms the standard at which all
          cryptocurrencies are valued. However, one of the many issues with the
          US Dollar and every other Fiat currency is that they are not crypto.
          Therefore, the network for Fiat Currencies are managed by untrustful
          entities, ‘The Banks’ and Government. These entities are now coming up
          with a solution for the industry that are CBDCS, which are essentially
          the same currencies, but they are just digital. Which basically gives
          them more control and oversight on every party that is going to deal
          in crypto, which is completely opposite of what SATOSHI NAKAMOTO set
          out to do with the very first Crypto, Bitcoin.
        </p>

        <p>
          Real Dollar, will compete directly with CBDCs to become the future
          medium of exchange of cryptocurrencies that is transparent yet
          private, uncontrolled by any singular entity, and will have a value
          that will be constantly decided by the community.
